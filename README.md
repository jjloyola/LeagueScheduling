# README
This is the solution to an instance of the League Scheduling Problem. It is solved using python and docplex. 

To run the solver, use **solveMP_cloud.py** (an API key is needed for it to work). The file **NASL_MP.py** contain the model (objectives and constraints),  and **NASL_MP.ipynb** contains the same code, but as a Jupyter Notebook. 

The **data** folder contains the input files.
